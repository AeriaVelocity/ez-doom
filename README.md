# EzDOOM

EzDOOM (Easy DOOM) is a Rust/GTK utility which allows you to quickly and easily
install and set up DOOM on GNU/Linux systems through the Flatpak package
manager.

EzDOOM was created out of frustration with the Flatpak version of GZDoom and
how needlessly complicated it is to get set up with mods and all that. EzDOOM
aims to solve this through a simple installation wizard and a simple
configuration utility.
